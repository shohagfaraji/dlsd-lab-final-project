## 📘 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a simple yet effective **4-way traffic light system** designed using **digital logic ICs**, primarily the **74HC4017 Johnson Decade Counter** and a **555 timer** in astable mode. It cycles through standard traffic light sequences for four directions, simulating a real-world traffic intersection.

## 📌 Notes

-   This is a **purely hardware-based** digital logic project – no software or programming required.
-   The timing and transition speed can be adjusted using the potentiometer.
-   Designed and tested on a breadboard with real components.
